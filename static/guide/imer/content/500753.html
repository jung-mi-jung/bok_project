            recognized him “for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and thereby having
            transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of economic policy.”</p>
        <p>His work has brought about a rapid and revolutionary development: application of the rational expectations
            hypothesis, emergence of an equilibrium theory of business cycles, insights into the difficulties of using
            economic policy to control the economy, and possibilities of reliably evaluating economic policy with
            statistical methods,” the Academy noted.</p>
