			<li>The Foreign Exchange Transactions Act stipulates the procedures required for any foreign exchange transaction, in each of three areas: "transaction type", "payment and receipt", and "method of payment and receipt". Foreign exchange transactions are regulated largely in terms of the area of "payment and receipt". Nevertheless, the act also stipulates separate procedures related to "transaction type" for the cases of capital transactions which accompany movements of large amounts of funds.</li>
			<li>So as to avoid possible overlapping of procedures for the same transactions, however, separate notification or permission is not required when a transaction has already been certified as an allowed one in terms of its "transaction type".</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Transaction Type</h3>
		<p>Restrictions like the permission requirement for payments and receipts for current transactions can not be adopted unless they are unavoidable in order to faithfully fulfill international treaties and laws or contribute to international efforts to maintain international peace and security. Therefore, general current transactions do not need to receive any permission. However, several types of current transactions do require notification or confirmation for the purpose of monitoring.</p>
		<p>The regulatory system for capital transactions is a sort of negative system, in which a person is principally free to execute any capital transaction after making notification to the authority, and certain transactions without any notification, except for the cases of transactions on the negative list specified in the Act or by Presidential Decree. Transactions on the negative list such as loans, guarantees, financial derivatives and overseas portfolio investment require advance permission in certain cases.</p>

		</ul>
		<h3>Payment and Receipt</h3>
		<h4>Payment</h4>
		<p>Payments for current transactions are freely permitted as long as documents certifying the reason for and amount of payment (evidential documents for payment) are submitted. Only some payments require prior confirmation of or notification to the Bank of Korea.</p>
		<p>Payments for capital transactions are also possible when necessary procedures such as prior notification are completed. There are some restrictions on receiving from or making payment to terror related individuals and groups on the list adopted by the UN Security Council Committee (refer to Appendix 3).</p>

		<ul class="bu type1">
			<li>Overseas Travel Expenses
				<p>Any overseas traveller may export overseas travel expenses by carrying up to US$ 10,000 without notification, over US$ 10,000 with notification to customs. The traveler is also allowed to pay for travel expenses abroad with credit cards. Overseas sojourners and overseas students may pay their overseas travel expenses through any foreign exchange banks.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Overseas Emigration Expenses
				<p>There is no limit on the amount of overseas emigration expenses. Expenses must be remitted within three years from the date on which the emigrant receives an overseas emigrant certificate from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<br />
				When the accumulated payment per household exceeds US$ 100,000, a certificate of the source of funds issued by the tax office must be submitted to the designated bank.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Donation Payment
				<p>Korean residents are allowed to remit abroad without any underlying documentation. If the total amount of payments per person exceeds US$ 10,000 in a year, this must be reported to the Korean National Tax Administration.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Payment by Foreigners or Nonresidents
				<p>Any foreigner or nonresident must pay through a designated bank when he or she remits a donation of under US$ 50,000 per year, or remits his or her income earned in Korea.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Receipt</h4>
		<p>There is no specific restriction. However, any transaction is regarded as a donation unless evidential documentation is submitted.</p>

		<h3>Methods of Payment and Receipt</h3>
		<p>Most settlement methods are freely permitted without limitation. Only a few specific settlement methods such as netting, payments exceeding the periods prescribed by the MOSF, third party payments, and payments bypassing foreign exchange banks are subject to declaration to the Bank of Korea or, in certain cases, the designated foreign exchange banks. The purpose of implementing this declaration system is to permit the monitoring of foreign exchange flows and the taking of early action to prevent any severe disruption of the domestic foreign exchange market or the balance of payments.</p>

		<h3>Purchases and Sales of Foreign Exchange</h3>

			<li>Foreign exchange banks must, when they purchase foreign exchange, confirm whether the acquisition of such foreign exchange by the selling customer is subject to notification or other requirements. Nonresidents who intend to sell banks foreign exchange over US$ 20,000 without documentation as to acquisition must make declaration to the Bank of Korea. In principle, banks must report any purchase of foreign exchange over US$ 20,000 per case to the National Tax Administration.</li>
			<li>There is no ceiling on how much foreign exchange a foreign exchange bank may sell to a national resident. To a nonresident, a bank may sell up to the amount of foreign exchange the nonresident has sold since his last entrance date, or US$ 10,000 if he has no evidence of sale of foreign exchange. If nonresidents intend to purchase foreign exchange exceeding these limits, they must declare this to the Bank of Korea. Banks must notify the National Tax Administration when they sell foreign exchange in an amount over US$ 10,000 to the same person on the same day.</li>
			<li>Money changers may also purchase foreign currency and traveler's check from residents and nonresidents, and may re-exchange to nonresidents. Limits on such deals are, in principle, the same as those on deals with banks.</li>

		<h3>Exports and Imports of Means of Payment</h3>
		<h4>Exports of Means of Payment</h4>
		<p>Residents may export foreign currency in the amount of US$ 10,000 or less without any restriction. Otherwise, they need the permission of the BOK except in certain cases, for example, when the currency is for travel expenses.<br />Upon leaving Korea, nonresidents may carry foreign currency in the amount of up to US$ 10,000 or the amount they have previously sold during their stay in Korea. For any additional amount, they need the permission of the BOK.<br />Exports of domestic currency in excess of the equivalent of US$ 10,000 require declaration to the customs office.</p>

		<h4>Imports of Means of Payment</h4>
		<p>Any person who hand-carries the equivalent of more than US$ 10,000 of means of payment into Korea must declare this to the customs office.</p>
