<h2>Overview of Securities Business</h2>
<h3>Business related to open market operations </h3>
<h4>Issuance and redemption of Monetary Stabilization Bond issued by the BOK</h4>
<p>The Bank of Korea(hereinafter, ‘BOK’) carries out open market operations to affect the level of reserves in the banking institutions. In recent years, open market operations have been more actively employed as a tool for achieving policy objectives.</p>
<p>The BOK participates in the open market directly, buying or selling special negotiable obligations it has issued called Monetary Stabilization Bonds(MSBs). Since their introduction, MSBs have played an important role in controlling the reserve positions of banking institutions. For example, the BOK issues MSBs on a large scale when necessary to absorb any vast expansion of money supply.</p>
<p>When issuing MSBs by competitive tender, the BOK selects one or two methods of setting the price, in consideration of financial market conditions: the conventional method, whereby the successful bidding prices or interest rates are individually applied, and the Dutch method, whereby the lowest price or the highest rate among successful tenders is uniformly applied. In practice, the BOK normally uses the Dutch method at present. </p>
<h4>Purchases and sales of government and public bonds owned by the BOK</h4>
<p>The BOK buys or sells government and public bonds for the purpose of open market operations. The BOK also purchases or sells government and public bonds under repurchase agreements(RPs) with eligible counterparties.</p>
<h3>Business for the government </h3>
<h4>Issuance and redemption of Treasury Bonds</h4>
