<!-- <h2>FIP Achievements</h2>
<h3>Bank Industry</h3>
<p>Informatization of the bank industry got into stride from the late eighties, when banks constructed the Interbank CD/ATM network (1988) and the Interbank Funds Transfer network (1989), electronic-based interbank shared networks designed to improve the level of customer service and give the banks a competitive edge. </p>
<p>The launch of these interbank shared networks enabled bank customers to deposit and withdraw money at bank branches anywhere in the country, without having to go to the banks where their accounts had been opened. More notably, it allowed them to make on-line funds transfers to customers of other banks. This made the whole country a same-day settlement zone. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the constant increase in interbank settlement values, it also became clear that a safe and efficient system for large-value settlement was needed. In response, the Bank of Korea developed BOK-Wire, the nation’s only large-value RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) system, which commenced operation in December 1994. In April 2009, the bank then successfully launched BOK-Wire+, which added liquidity savings features to the existing RTGS system. </p>
<p>Since the 2000s, various systems such as the Cash Management System have been set up to link banks and their major corporate clients, and home banking via telephone, the Internet or mobile phone has become widespread. Electronic linkages between banks and non-bank financial institutions are now also common. </p>
<p>In fact, with the introduction of various electronic-based payment systems ranging from the Electronic Giro System to the Electronic Money System, and with the launch of BOK-Wire+ as the primary large-value interbank settlement system, the overall framework of bank industry informatization in Korea is considered to be reasonably advanced. </p>
<p>Koreans have traditionally had a strong preference for cash and checks, and the history of electronic-based payment instruments is relatively short here in comparison with that of developed countries. However, as the financial informatization of Korea has made progress rapidly, there is a growing shift toward the use of electronic-based payment and settlement media, particularly the BOK-Wire+ and the Financial Shared Networks. </p>

<h3>Non-Bank Financial Industry</h3>
<p>Informatization of the non-bank financial industry has also been steadily promoted since the mid-1970s. The securities industry has constructed various information systems, such as the Transaction Contraction System, the Futures Trading System, the Stock Price Index Futures System, the Stock Price Index Options System, etc. In the late 1990s, an online stock trading system was developed, which in recent years has handled more than half of total stock trading activities. </p>
<p>The insurance industry has constructed various inquiry systems in the car insurance field, the High Value Contracts Risk Management System, the Traffic Law Contravention Information Exchange System, etc. </p> -->
