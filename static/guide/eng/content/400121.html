<h2>Currency Timelin</h2>
<h3>2006 ~</h3>
<p>When new banknotes and coins whose denominations were identical but designs and sizes differed, were issued, their classification titles used to be '原&lsquo;, &rsquo;新&lsquo;, &rsquo;改&lsquo;, &rsquo;改甲&lsquo; (in the order of issuance). However, since May 1, 1993, the classification titles of banknotes issued since the Third Currency Reform in 1962 have become 'Ga' (first), 'Na' (second), 'Da' (third), 'Ra' (fourth).</p>
<h3>Since 2006</h3>
<p class="fc1">State-of-art anti-counterfeiting devices have been adopted and the level of artistic sophistication raised since 2006. Various state-of-art anti-counterfeiting devices have been incorporated in banknotes. Their design was modernized and their size was reduced to that common in advanced countries. In 2009, new high denomination notes (50,000-won notes) were issued, the first increase in the highest denomination note for 36 years.</p>
<p>State-of-art anti-counterfeiting devices have been adopted and the level of artistic sophistication raised since 2006. Because of the enhancement of computer-linked devices, the number of forged banknotes increased sharply and counterfeits had become more elaborate. Against this backdrop, more state-of-art anti-counterfeiting features were adopted, such as optically variable devices, moving-image-type windowed security threads, color-shifting ink and intaglio latent images. The size of banknotes was reduced to that in advanced countries for convenience in use. Their colors also became brighter and more colorful. The whole design system including lettering, numbering, the governor's seal and braille recognition, was changed to suit modern taste. Various themes were adopted for banknotes such as science, art and philosophy. Design images became more complex with fresh background patterns being used. The 50,000-won notes, in particular, differ from other denominations in that they have a female portrait (Shin Saimdang) on the obverse and a vertical design on the reverse. The Ma (fifth) 5,000-won notes were first issued on January 2, 2006. Ba (sixth) 10,000-won notes and Da (third) 1,000-won notes were first issued on January 22, 2007. The 50,000-won notes were first issued on June 23, 2009.</p>
