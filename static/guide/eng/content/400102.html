<h2>Financial Stability Board(FSB)</h2>

<h3>Objectives and Business Areas</h3>
<p>The FSB was established as the successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) that was founded in 1999 in a bid to seek international cooperation on finding ways to prevent a financial crisis, effectively address it when it occurs and strengthen the stability of the international financial system. It originally consisted of 12 member countries, including G7 countries and Australia, and 10 international organizations such as the IMF and BCBS, but in 2009 the expanded FSF with 13 new members, including Korea, changed its name to the Financial Stability Board. The FSB member institutions include central banks, regulatory authorities and finance ministries of the member countries.</p>
<p>The FSB is advantageous for carrying out a wide range of activities since financial authorities of member states and international standard-setting bodies are participating as its member institutions. Its major topics for discussion cover addressing the vulnerabilities of the global financial system, ending too-big-to-fail, developing shadow banking regulations, implementing OTC derivatives and coordinating benchmark reforms.</p>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>The FSB consists of the Plenary Meeting in charge of decision making, the Steering Committee which provides operational guidance, the Secretariat, six Regional Consultative Groups and four Standing Committees.</p>

<h3>The Bank of Korea's Activities</h3>
<p>The Bank of Korea, joined the FSB in March 2009, when it was expanding its membership following the reorganization from its predecessor, the FSF. Ever since, the Bank has been proactively acting as a member institution, not only participating in the FSB Plenary Meeting but also joining one of the 4 standing committees, the Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities (SCAV), and actively contributing to assessing the vulnerabilities of the global financial system and establishing the necessary policy measures. The Bank has also been participating in the Analytical Group on Vulnerabilities (AGV), the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and the Shadow Banking Working Group. Moreover, from 2011, the Bank served as the co-chair of the FSB RCGfA (Regional Consultative group for Asia) for 2 years and has&nbsp;hosted several FSB related meetings, including the FSB Plenary meeting in October 2010.</p>
