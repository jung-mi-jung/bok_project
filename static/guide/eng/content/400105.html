<h3>Development Process</h3>
<p>As governmental recognition of the importance of financial informatiization improved steadily from the early 1980s, the financial field was selected, along with administration, education, research, national defense and social security fields, as one of the nation's key fields, which should be informationalized through establishment of its own computer network.
