<h2>Monetary Policy Instruments</h2>
<h3>Lending and Deposit Facilities</h3>
<p>The central bank's lending and deposit facilities are policy instruments through which it supplies loans to or receives deposits from individual financial institutions (under the Bank of Korea Act, financial institutions are limited to banking institutions). Traditionally, a central bank's monetary policy instruments refer to its lending facilities along with its open market operations and reserve requirement regime. As a number of central banks have introduced standing facilities allowing individual financial institutions to both take out temporary loans and make temporary deposits, their lending facilities have developed into lending and deposit facilities.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea also extended and reformed its existing lending facilities to turn them into lending and deposit facilities, by newly introducing Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits, the standing facilities, in March 2008.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea's regular lending facilities currently include ① 'Liquidity Adjustment Loans,' provided to financial institutions experiencing fund shortage in the process of their fund supply and demand, ② 'Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility', support given up to a certain ceiling taking into account financial and economic conditions and the financial trends of small and medium-sized enterprises and regions, etc,and ③ 'Intraday Overdrafts,' provided to financial institutions facing temporary shortages of funds for settlement until the daily funds-transfer business closing. These loans can be implemented in the form of bill rediscounts or securities collateral loans, with the types of collateral including credit securities, government and public bonds and Monetary Stabilization Bonds.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with the Bank of Korea Act, the Bank can conduct credit operations with financial institutions at times when liquidity deteriorates due for example to imbalances between financing and use of funds, and also with for-profit enterprises when severe impediments to obtaining funds from financial institutions occur or when there is a strong likelihood of their occurrence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea also operates 'Liquidity Adjustment Deposit' facilities, which enable financial institutions to deposit their excess cash arising in the process of their supply of and demand for funds.</p>
