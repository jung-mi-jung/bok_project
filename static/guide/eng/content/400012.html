<h2>Monetary Policy</h2>
<h3>Objectives of Monetary Policy</h3>

<p><span class="fc1">A monetary policy</span> is generally the process through which a central bank <span class="fc1">with a sole right to issue its own currency (legal tender or monetary base)</span> maintains the value of that currency, that is, <span class="fc1">price</span>, and achieves sustainable economic growth by managing <span class="fc1">the amount of money (monetary base and money created in the banking system)</span> in circulation, and <span class="fc1">price (interest rate)</span> in the economy.</p>
<div class="topGroup">
<p>Money is a unit of account for the prices of goods, services, and financial and real assets. And it can be a medium of exchange and carry out a storage of value function.</p></div>
<p><span class="fc1">Article 1, Clause 1 of the「Bank of Korea Act」</span> stipulates that the purpose of this Act is &ldquo;<span class="fc1">to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by pursuing price stability</span> through the formulation and implementation of efficient monetary policy&rdquo;. Accordingly, the Bank of Korea takes <span class="fc1">price stability</span> as <span class="fc1">the most important objective</span> of its monetary policy. If prices become unstable, uncertainty concerning the future mounts, discouraging economic activities as a whole, and the distribution of income and resources grows distorted. As a result, the stability in economic conditions as a whole is damaged.</p>
<p><span class="fc1">For the national economy</span> to achieve <span class="fc1">stable growth</span>, it should be supported by not only price stability but also <span class="fc1">financial stability</span>. Regarding this, <span class="fc1">Article 1, Clause 2 of the「Bank of Korea Act」</span> stipulates that &ldquo;The Bank of Korea needs to pay attention to financial stability in the implementation of monetary policy&rdquo;. Thus, the Bank of Korea is also making policy efforts to maintain <span class="fc1">financial stability</span> while pursuing price stability through implementing its monetary policy.</p>
