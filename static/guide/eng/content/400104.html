<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="first"><strong class="fc1">Since 1946</strong>, when the first computer in the world was developed, many developed countries have made great efforts to improve the qualities of life and economic efficiency by promoting informatization in all sectors of society through various devices such as computers and telecommunication technologies.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="fc1">The informatization of financial institutions in Korea</strong> began in the late 1960s, when salary payments of banks were computerized. However, the widespread adoption of the financial informatization began in the late 1970s, when deposit banks developed internal on-line networks and office automation systems.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="fc1">With recent environmental changes,</strong> such as the rapid development of information technology(IT), the diversification of customer desires, the increasing labor costs of financial institutions and the dramatic rise in the payment and settlement volume, the informatization of the financial industry has made significant progress. By appropriately addressing these changes and efficiently promoting financial informatization, the financial industry has achieved many objectives, such as same-day settlement and the introduction of advanced IT management systems  of financial information.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="fc1">Financial informatization in Korea</strong> has been promoted not only by the official promotion organization, the Committee on Financial Informatization Promotion(hereinafter referred to as the “CFIP”), but also by the financial institutions themselves. However, most large-scale projects, requiring the collaborative cooperation of more than two institutions, have been promoted through the CFIP in accordance with the related acts and regulations.</p>
