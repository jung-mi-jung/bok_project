			The Bank of Korea was established on June
			12, 1950, following the passage of the Bank of
			Korea Act on May 5 of that year, to serve as
			the central bank of Korea with the purposes of
			stabilizing the value of the national currency,
			promoting the soundness of the banking and
			credit systems, and developing the Korean
			economy. This took place against a backdrop
			of hyperinflation and economic turmoil in
			the years immediately after Korea’s liberation
			from Japan. The Bank began initially as a government-
			invested organization with paid-in
			capital of 1.5 billion won, but was later reorganized
			in 1962 as a non-capital special organization
			in accordance with the first revision of
			the Bank of Korea Act.
			At the time of its enactment, the Bank of
			Korea Act specified the Bank’s role as the
			central bank in devising and implementing
			monetary, credit and foreign xchange policies.
			In 1962, however, the Act was revised
			in a direction that enabled the Bank to actively
			support the government-led economic
			growth initiatives. Its top decision-making
			body, the

			The Monetary Policy Board was accordingly
			renamed the Monetary Board of Korea, while
			the number of its government-nominated
			members increased significantly. In addition,
			most of its functions related to the formulation
			of foreign exchange policy and the management
			of the foreign exchange reserves were
			transferred to the government.

			From the late 1980s, in line with the promotion
			of financial liberalization, there were
			active discussions regarding the expansion of
			the central bank’s role in maintaining price
			stability as well as its independence, leading to amendments to the Bank of Korea Act in 1997
			and 2003. The reforms in the 1997 amendment
			included the introduction of an inflation
			targeting regime and the restoration of the
			name Monetary Policy Board, while all Board
			members were given the position of standing
			member. In addition, the position of Board
			chair was transferred from the Minister of
			Finance and Economy to the Governor of the
			Bank. This change served to enhance the neutrality
			and autonomy of the Bank. However,
			the authority to supervise banks moved from
			the Bank to a newly-established joint financial
			supervisory institution. The 2003 revision of
			the Act meanwhile stipulated the operation
			of inflation targeting from a medium-term
			perspective, while the Bank was delegated the
			additional functions of oversight and monitoring
			of the payment and settlement systems.
			In addition, the Senior Deputy Governor of
			the Bank was given the position of ex-officio
			member of the Monetary Policy Board, and
			the portion of the budget subject to prior
			government approval was narrowed from encompassing
			all expenditures to covering only
			expenditures classified as salary.

			The Global Financial Crisis provided an
			impetus for accelerated discussions of legislative
			amendments to strengthen the Bank’s
			function of financial stabilization, so as to establish
			conditions to facilitate the prevention
			of financial instability and the implementation
			of swift countermeasures in response to
			financial crises. This led to another revision of the Bank of Korea Act in 2011. The revised Act stipulates the purpose of the Bank as the promotion of price stability through the formulation and implementation of effective monetary policy, with a focus on financial stability in the process. The Act thus states that the Bank, being in charge of monetary policy, has a mandate for financial stability alongside its primary objective of price stability. Under the revision of the Act in 2012, it was then stipulated that candidates for the post of Governor of the Bank must pass through a National Assembly confirmation hearing process prior to appointment. In addition, the Act was revised in 2018 for the purpose of introducing a system of staggered terms196), which ensures service terms of varying lengths for members of the Monetary Policy Board by adjusting the term lengths of some members, and adding local governments to the list of entities that are subject to the collection of data for the Bank’s statistics and economic survey activities.
