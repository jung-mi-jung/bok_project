<p>In collaboration with the Korean government, the Bank of Korea has been participating in the establishment of major policies regarding international financial institutions, and has overall responsibility for cooperation with international financial organizations through exchanges and financial transactions. The Bank of Korea is also actively involved in exchanges and cooperative activities with international central bank cooperative bodies as well as other central banks worldwide, endeavoring to come up with effective policy responses to changes in the financial environment such as the integration of financial markets and globalization. Since the 1997 foreign currency crisis, the Bank of Korea, together with the Korean government, has exerted active efforts internationally to ensure that Korea's position is reflected and to share information on the issues of globalization, reforms of international financial organizations, restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debts, the development and implementation of international codes and standards, choice of appropriate exchange rate regime, combating the financing of terrorism and anti-money laundering measures.</p>

<h2 class="mt40 mb20">Cooperation with Central Bank Cooperative Bodies</h2>
<p>The financial environment has been dramatically changed as financial markets around the world have integrated rapidly with the financial innovation and globalization taking place since the mid-1980s. To pursue domestic financial market stability and to implement effective monetary policies, the Bank of Korea has made great efforts to cooperate with international central bank cooperative bodies and other nations' central banks. After becoming a member of SEANZA(abolished in 2020) in 1966, the Bank of Korea joined SEACEN in 1990, EMEAP in 1991 and the BIS in 1997. In these groups, the Bank of Korea works on maintaining close relationships with fellow member banks and on establishing an effective international cooperative structure for discussing current financial issues. </p>

		<p>Korea joined the IMF on August 26, 1955, as the 58th country to enter the Fund, with the aim of procuring funds necessary for its economic development. Upon its accession, Korea's quota in the IMF was SDR 12.5 million, only 0.14% of the total. As Korea's importance in the global community has increased through its economic development, however, by end-September 2021, its quota had increased to SDR 8,582.7 million (1.80% of the total, 16th among all members).</p>
		<p>Due to its weak economic condition, for a considerable period of time since its IMF accession in 1955, Korea had been able to avail itself of the Transitional Agreements (Article XIV of the Articles of Agreement), which allow restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. In the mid-1980s, however, when Korea's balance of payments position improved, it eased some foreign exchange regulations related to external transactions. From November 1, 1988, Korea became subject to Article VIII, which prohibits discriminatory or multilateral currency agreements and also prohibits foreign exchange regulation on current international transactions.</p>
		<p>In the late-1980s, Korea was then acknowledged for the soundness of its balance of payments and external reserve conditions, as its balance of payments had recorded continual surpluses. In March 1987, Korea was included on the IMF's financial transaction counterparty list. Since then it has been delisted a few times, but has now remained solidly on the list since March 2002.</p>
