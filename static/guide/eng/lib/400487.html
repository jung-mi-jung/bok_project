<h3 class="mt0">Other International Cooperation Activities</h3>
<p>In addition to the areas of international cooperation already mentioned, the Bank of Korea makes a variety of other efforts to strengthen the foundation for its cooperation with other central banks and the international financial sector.</p>
<p>First, in order to strengthen its relationships with other central banks through the sharing of policy experiences and staff exchanges, the Bank of Korea has been holding an annual Central Banking Seminar since 1989, in which central bankers from around the world - from advanced countries including the US, UK and Germany, from emerging markets, and from transitional economies - give presentations on and discuss issues of mutual interest and other policy matters.</p>
<p>With Korea taking on a more significant role in the global economy, the Bank of Korea (BOK) launched the Knowledge Partnership Program (BOK-KPP) in 2015, which provides developing countries’ central banks with tailored policy consultation and training program. It aims to promote financial market development and macroeconomic policies in order to support the long-term economic growth of the countries, and enhance their expertise in the fields of central banking.</p>
<p>As a member of the Korean government delegation, the Bank of Korea participates in various economic conferences, such as those held by the OECD. The Bank of Korea also takes an active part in annual meetings with international credit rating agencies, including S&P, Moody's, and Fitch.</p>


<h2 class="mt40">KPP</h2>
<h3>WHAT IS THE KPP FOR?</h3>
<p>In 2015, the Bank of Korea initiated the Knowledge Partnership Program (shortly 'KPP'), a policy advisory and technical support program aimed at fostering international cooperation and enhancing mutual understanding with central banks worldwide. As the central bank in the country that had experienced remarkable growth and had successfully overcome numerous challenges in the process, the Bank of Korea was considered uniquely positioned to impart its vast knowledge and experience in policymaking, implementation, and building resilient financial systems and infrastructure to other central banks seeking such guidance (hereafter referred to as 'partner central banks').</p>

<h3>WHAT DOES THE KPP OFFER & DEAL WITH?</h3>
<ul class="bu">
	<li>Through the KPP, the Bank of Korea provides the partner central banks with comprehensive policy consultations encompassing an in-depth analysis, policy recommendations, and training opportunities, tailored to the partner central banks’ needs.</li>
	<li>The KPP can cover all central banking topics, including monetary and credit policy, financial markets, financial stability, economic research, statistical compilation, payment and settlement systems, currency issuance, foreign exchange policy, and foreign reserve management.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HOW ARE THE KPP PROJECETS DETERMINED & IMPLEMENTED?</h3>
<ul class="bu">
	<li>Each year, the KPP project topics are carefully determined through a mutual consent process between the Bank of Korea and partner central bank. The process involves receiving proposals from each partner central bank, conducting a comprehensive review by the Bank of Korea, and reaching a conclusion by signing a bilateral agreement between the two banks.</li>
	<li>Once the topic is chosen, the project is executed by a KPP Team which consists of the Bank of Korea staff, research consultants from a distinguished economic institute employed by the Bank of Korea, and officials from the partner central bank who possess expertise and experience in the consultation topic. Over approximately eight months, the team conducts in-depth collaborative research joining various activities (see the next page for details).</li>
	<li>The recommendations and proposed solutions as a result of extensive joint studies are then meticulously organized and presented in the form of a final report to the partner central bank.</li>
</ul>

<h3>WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED IN A KPP PROJECT?</h3>

<h4>Preliminary Meeting</h4>
<p>Prior to the project's commencement, a preliminary meeting takes place in the partner central bank's country, Korea or online. During this meeting, the KPP Team elaborates on the selected topic and establishes an action plan to ensure a comprehensive understanding and clarity for the subsequent activities.</p>

<h3>Kick-off Seminar and Field Study</h3>
<p>The Korean KPP team visits the partner central bank’s country, where representatives from both central banks sign the Bilateral Agreement for the KPP project. A kick-off seminar is held to discuss the research outline and exchange ideas about the consultation topic. During the visit, the KPP Team conducts field studies by interviewing senior executives and working-level staff from the partner central bank, as well as relevant organizations in the country.</p>

<h3>Interim Seminar and Capacity-building Training Program</h3>
<p>An interim seminar is held in Korea to present an interim report containing the findings from the diagnostic study and case studies. During this seminar, the team will gather feedback and comments not only from officials of the partner central bank but also from a group of experts. Additionally, as part of the project's capacity-building efforts, training sessions and study visit programs to relevant institutions in Korea are arranged and provided for the staff of the partner central bank.</p>

<h3>Policy Recommendations and Final Dissemination Seminar</h3>
<p>The policy recommendations and action plans that the KPP team has developed are integrated into a final report, which incorporates feedback and comments from both the Bank of Korea and the partner central bank, aligning with the project’s objectives. The final report is presented during the final seminar, which takes place in the partner central bank's country. The aim of this seminar is to disseminate the outcomes of the KPP project to various stakeholders, including government officials, participants from the financial sector, and academics.</p>
<p class="">All costs incurred from the above activities are borne by the Bank of Korea.</p>

<h3>WHAT HAVE WE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE KPP SO FAR?</h3>
<p>During 2015~2023, the Bank of Korea has successfully executed 53 KPP projects with ten partner central banks primarily from the Asian region. All the participants have expressed high satisfaction with the program's diverse activities and positive outcomes. They have acknowledged the significant benefits of the knowledge acquired and policy recommendations provided, which have been instrumental in their professional work and future development.</p>
