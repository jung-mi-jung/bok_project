For such meetings, the agenda is drawn up by the chairman or by at least two members, and the decisions made at the meeting are adopted through a simple majority with at least five members attending. Meanwhile, the minutes detailing the discussions at the meeting are drawn up and the parts relevant to monetary policy are published on the website of the Bank of Korea after a certain length of time.</p>
<p>Apart from the regular meetings, council meetings are also held to deliberate on submitted agenda items, such as monetary policy, as well as significant topics including domestic and international economic and financial issues. Furthermore, special council meetings are convened to conduct in-depth examinations of matters requiring extended discussion, such as budget plans of the Bank of Korea.</p>
