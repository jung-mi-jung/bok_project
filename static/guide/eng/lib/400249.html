			<h3 class="mt0">Issuing Banknotes and Coins</h3>
			<p>The Bank of Korea has the exclusive right to issue banknotes and coins within Korea. Their dimensions, designs and denominations are determined by the Monetary Policy Board upon the government’s approval. The banknotes and coins thus issued have the status of legal tender within the country for all transactions, both public and private, without limitation.</p>
			<p>The issuance of banknotes and coins depends ultimately on decisions made by the Bank in line with its monetary policy. There is no maximum limit imposed on the issuance of banknotes and coins.</p>
			<p>There are currently four different denominations of banknotes in circulation: 1,000-won, 5,000-won, 10,000-won and 50,000-won; and six of coins: 1-won, 5-won, 10-won, 50-won, 100-won and 500-won. The Bank has issued redesigned 5,000-won banknotes since January 2006, and redesigned 1,000-won and 10,000- won banknotes since January 2007. These new banknotes incorporate sophisticated anti-counterfeiting features with reduced size.</p>
			<p>In addition, the Bank put 50,000-won banknotes, as a new highest denomination, into circulation on June 23, 2009, so as to reduce the inconvenience arising from the previous denomination structure.</p>

			<h3>Formulating and implementing Monetary and Credit Policy</h3>
			<p>The most important mission of the Bank of Korea is its formulation and implementation of monetary policy. This involves controlling the supply and value of money so that the economy can grow in a sound manner on the basis of price stability. To this end, the Bank conducts its monetary policy with an emphasis on price stability, while also taking into account such matters as economic growth and financial system stability.</p>
			<p>The Bank introduced an inflation targeting regime in 1998, changing the operational framework for its monetary policy from monetary aggregate-oriented to interest rate-oriented, with the call rate (the uncollateralized overnight rate) constituting its policy rate and operating target. The Bank then reformed and realigned its monetary policy framework again in March 2008, through measures including a change in the policy rate from the call rate target to the Bank of Korea Base Rate, improvement of the reserve requirement system, the regularization of open market operations, and the introduction of standing facilities.</p>
			<p>Inflation targeting is the monetary policy regime adopted by the Bank of Korea. This monetary policy framework focuses on inflation itself as the ultimate goal, which it aims to achieve over a mid-term horizon, instead of setting intermediate targets such as money supply aggregates.</p>
			<p>Based on Article 6, Clause 1 of the Bank of Korea Act, the Bank sets the mid-term inflation target in consultation with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The inflation target for 2016 onwards has been set at 2 percent, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bank conducts monetary policy to maintain the annual rate of CPI inflation near the target over a mid-term horizon.</p>
			<p>The Bank of Korea publishes its Monetary Policy Report, a statutory report submitted to the National Assembly, four times a year to explain how it is implementing the inflation target policy. If inflation deviates from the target by more than 0.5 percentage point in either direction for six consecutive months, the Bank explains the reasons for the deviation, the future prospects for inflation, and the monetary policy strategy for returning inflation to the target; such explanation may be provided through various means, such as a Governor’s press conference. If inflation subsequently remains more than 0.5 percentage point above or below the target, the Bank of Korea provides further explanations every three months.</p>
			<p>The current inflation target has been set for the period from 2016 to 2018. The next target will be set before this target expires at the end of 2018. If adjustment of the inflation target becomes necessary, due for instance to unexpected economic shocks at home or abroad or to changes in economic conditions, the Monetary Policy Board will adjust the target in consultation with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.</p>
			<p>To achieve its ultimate goal of maintaining price stability, the Monetary Policy Board sets the Base Rate eight times a year, in overall consideration of price movements, economic activity and financial market conditions. The Bank then attempts to steer the call rate so that it converges with the newly-set Base Rate level, using its policy instruments. Any change in the call rate affects market interest rates such as CD and Treasury bond yields and bank deposit and lending rates. These changes in interest rates tend to influence consumption and investment and, as a result, inflation.</p>
			<p>The Bank conducts its monetary policy mainly through open market operations; lending and deposit facilities and reserve requirements are additional monetary policy instruments available to the Bank.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="fnote">Note: 1) The overnight call rate target until February 2008.</p>
			
			<h4>Open Market Operations</h4>
			<p>The Bank of Korea carries out open market operations as and when necessary to affect the level of reserves in the banking system and to steer the overnight call rate toward the Base Rate. Open market operations are conducted in three ways: through the issuance and repurchase of Monetary Stabilization Bonds (MSBs), through securities transactions, and through commercial banks’ deposits with the Monetary Stabilization Account (MSA).</p>
			<p>MSBs, which are issued by the Bank, originated as a major tool of monetary policy during the period when the volume of government and government-guaranteed bonds remained insufficient. As MSBs have relatively long maturities, they are now used for the structural adjustment of market liquidity. By maturity, there are 13 types of MSBs varying from 14-day MSBs to 2-year MSBs. Currently, however, only 91-day, 182-day, 1-year, and 2-year MSBs are issued regularly through competitive bidding.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Securities transactions involve purchases and sales in the secondary market of government bonds, government-guaranteed bonds, and securities as specified by the Monetary Policy Board. Securities transactions take the form of outright transactions or of repurchase agreements (RPs). Transactions in RPs have since March 2008 been offered regularly on a weekly basis—mostly with seven-day maturities.</p>
			<p>The MSA, a market-friendly term-deposit facility with competitive bidding, was introduced in October 2010. The longest maturity of deposits with the account is 91 days, but the Bank mainly accepts MSA deposits of less than 1-month maturity.</p>
			<p>In 2017, the average balance of MSBs outstanding was 170.2 trillion won. During the same period, the average balances of outstanding RP (net) sales and the MSA stood at 14.4 trillion won and 16.4 trillion won, respectively.</p>

			<h4>Lending and Deposit Facilities</h4>
			<p>To control the availability of banking institutions’ funds, the Bank of Korea operates lending and deposit facilities consisting of the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility, Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits, Intraday Overdrafts and Special Loans. The Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility is a program of low-interest rate loans extended by the Bank of Korea to banks based on their performances in lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), up to a ceiling set by the Monetary Policy Board in consideration of financial and economic conditions and regional as well as financial trends for SMEs. Individual financial institution quotas are allocated in consideration of their performances in trade financing, loans to start-up SMEs with creative technologies, and any other fund operating performance as stipulated by the Governor. Funds under the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility for regional branches of the Bank of Korea are distributed to the different individual regions based on their economic conditions and financial institutions’ performances in extending loans to regionally-based SMEs.</p>
			<p>Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits are standing facilities that enable financial institutions to borrow from the Bank of Korea to make up for shortages of funds, and to deposit surplus funds with the Bank. The financial institutions eligible to use the Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits are those subject to the holding of required reserves. Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits have maturities of one business day. The interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits are 100 basis points above and below the Bank of Korea Base Rate, respectively. These loans and deposits thus serve to prevent the call rate from deviating too widely from the Base Rate.</p>
			<p>Intraday Overdrafts were introduced in September 2000 to extend financial support to banks experiencing temporary shortages of settlement funds in the course of a day. They thus serve to stimulate fund transactions among financial institutions and, as a result, among corporations using those institutions. The Bank of Korea may extend Special Loans not only to financial institutions but also to other for-profit enterprises in the event of an emergency as stipulated under the Bank of Korea Act. Special Loans include emergency credit to financial institutions (Article 65) and credit to for-profit enterprises (Article 80).</p>

			<h4>Reserve Requirements</h4>

			<p>The reserve requirement system is one in which financial institutions are obliged to hold a certain ratio of their liabilities subject to reserve requirements (reserve requirement ratio) in their accounts with the central bank. The central bank can adjust market liquidity and promote financial stability by changing financial institutions’ funding conditions through adjustment of the reserve requirement ratio. For example, since raising the reserve requirement ratio causes banks to deposit more money as their required reserves, their capacity to provide loans and purchase securities is reduced, thus leading to a decline in the volume of money in circulation. Consequently, liquidity is reduced and the possibility of financial unrest arising from an excessive increase in lending can be averted.</p>
			<p>Reserve requirements are still regarded as an important monetary policy tool in a number of major countries including Korea, although used less frequently than in the past as the monetary base-focused orientation of monetary policy shifted to an interest rate-focused orientation around the world from the 1980s. The continued employment of reserve requirements is ascribable to their great usefulness in not only ensuring seamless payments and settlements among financial institutions across their checking accounts with the central bank by having them hold a certain proportion of their reserves in the accounts, but also enhancing the efficiency of interest rate policy by stabilizing short-term market rates.</p>
			<p>The financial institutions subject to the current reserve requirement regime include commercial banks and special banks. These institutions are required to maintain reserves corresponding to their reserve requirement ratios, set within a range of 0-7% depending upon deposit liability type. Meanwhile, under the revised Bank of Korea Act, from December 17, 2011, reserve requirements can be imposed on some types of bank debentures as well as on deposit liabilities. Financial institutions must maintain their required reserves in the Bank of Korea in the form of current deposits, but they may hold up to 35% of their reserves in the form of vault cash consisting of banknotes of the Bank of Korea.</p>

			<h3>Maintaining Financial System Stability</h3>
			<p>The Bank of Korea also has a mandate for maintaining and enhancing financial system stability. To achieve this, the Bank conducts comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions domestically and abroad, of financial market stability, and of the soundness of the financial system. It also develops and makes full use of a wide range of indicators to detect, assess and provide early and timely warning of various risks present in the financial system. Based upon these activities, the Bank prepares and releases a half-yearly Financial Stability Report, analyzing potential risks in the financial system and their effects while providing a comprehensive assessment of the system as a whole.</p>
			<p>Since the sound management of financial institutions is vital for the proper functioning of the financial system, the Bank makes constant use of information from financial institutions to monitor their business operations and financial conditions, and as necessary conducts on-site examinations of financial institutions jointly with the Financial Supervisory Service to determine their soundness. The focus of these examinations is on the facilitation of macroprudential policy—for example, detecting and responding in advance to systemic risks that can threaten the financial system as a whole—as well as on monitoring the soundness of individual financial institutions.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cont info_icon">
			<h3>Serving as the Banker to Banks</h3>
			<p>The Bank of Korea accepts deposits from and makes loans to banks and other financial institutions, thus serving as the ‘banker to banks’.</p>
			<p>It maintains current accounts for banking institutions, and the reserves kept by institutions in these accounts are used to clear checks and to settle interbank accounts, including those arising from use of BOK-Wire+, the Bank of Korea’s hybrid system for settlement of large-value interbank fund transfers.</p>
			<p>The Bank conducts credit operations with banks by rediscounting commercial bills or by extending them loans against eligible collateral with maturities of up to 1 year.</p>
			<p>As the lender of last resort, the Bank can also extend loans to banks facing difficulties in raising funds in the financial markets, particularly when no other lenders stand ready, for example in times of financial crisis.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cont info_icon">
			<h3>Serving as the Banker to the Government</h3>
			<h4>Treasury Services for the Government</h4>
			<p>The Bank handles the receipt of national revenues and the disbursement of national expenditures as the depositary of the government. The government maintains a current deposit account with the Bank, to which taxes and all other government revenues are concentrated. Also, the Bank may extend loans to the government.</p>
			<p>For the convenience of taxpayers, the Bank designates the branches of financial institutions as Treasury agencies. They, along with postal offices, receive taxes and other government revenues. Treasury fund payments are made via real-time electronic transfers of Treasury funds to creditors’ accounts through an electronic system connecting the government, the Bank of Korea and financial institutions.</p>
			<p>The Bank also performs a variety of tasks related to the issuance and redemption of government securities, including Treasury bills. In addition, it serves as a custodian of securities for the government.</p>

			<h3>Operating and Overseeing the Payment Systems</h3>
			<p>Economic agents such as households and corporations can pay for their purchases of goods and services directly with cash or by using financial institutions. The payments via financial institutions and financial transactions among financial institutions lead to the assumption by these institutions of settlement obligations toward each other. The Bank of Korea, as the banker to banks, provides financial institutions with current accounts, and financial institutions use these accounts with the Bank to settle their mutual obligations.</p>

			<p>To ensure smooth fund settlement among financial institutions, the Bank operates BOK-Wire+, the sole large value payment</p>

			<p>system in Korea. It also works to facilitate smooth fund settlement by providing intraday overdrafts to financial institutions temporarily short of settlement funds.<br>
			To ensure the safety and efficiency of the nation’s payment and settlement system as a whole, the Bank also oversees the various individual systems—monitoring and assessing them, and recommending any necessary improvements to the system operators.</p>

			<h3>Managing the Official Foreign Reserves</h3>
			<p>Foreign reserves are defined by the IMF as “those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for direct financing of payments imbalances, for indirectly regulating the magnitudes of such imbalances through intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and/or for other purposes.” Types of reserve assets include foreign exchange assets (consisting of foreign currency deposits and securities), gold, special drawing rights, and other claims.</p>
			<p>The Bank of Korea holds and manages the nation’s foreign reserves appropriately to ensure that they can serve as a safeguard in cases of emergency. It invests the reserves mainly in safe and liquid foreign assets, and strives to improve their profitability insofar as this does not detract from their safety.</p>
			<p>The Bank also makes efforts to stabilize the FX market, in consultation with the government. While it allows the exchange rate to be freely determined by economic fundamentals, as well as by the supply of and demand for foreign exchange in the market, the Bank can implement smoothing operations if needed, to calm disorder in the market and mitigate any rapid short-term changes in exchange rates.</p>

			<h3>Pursuing International Cooperation</h3>
			<p>The Bank of Korea engages in close cooperation and exchanges with central banks from around the world, as well as with international financial institutions.</p>
			<p>It maintains close ties with central banks of major countries including the US, Japan and China, in an effort to help it respond effectively to changes in the global economic and financial climate. As a member of organizations for cooperation among central banks such as the BIS, EMEAP and SEACEN, the Bank plays a leading role in discussions on current issues. It also hosts a Knowledge Partnership Program to share Korea’s experiences in achieving successful economic development and in overcoming financial crises with other central banks in developing Asia-Pacific countries.</p>
			<p>In addition, the Bank participates enthusiastically in the major activities of international forums, including the G20 and ASEAN+3, and in international financial institutions, such as the IMF, the World Bank Group and the ADB, in order to promote Korea’s national interests on the international stage.</p>

			<h3>Providing Economic Education</h3>
			<p>The Bank of Korea undertakes diverse activities to boost public awareness about the Bank and the Korean economy.</p>
			<p>The BOK Friday Class program for university students and the general public is held on a weekly basis. On-the-job training courses for teachers are provided as well. The Bank has expanded its supplementary economic tutoring sessions at universities and in workplaces with a focus on professional fields where those receiving the tutoring could utilize the practical knowledge and experiences of the Bank’s staff. It also conducts programs such as Economic Camps for Youth and Economic Lectures for Youth (visiting lectures and field trips to the Bank of Korea) to provide teenagers with direct education on the economy. In addition, to promote greater understanding of its role in formulating and implementing monetary policy, it holds an annual Monetary Policy Challenge for college students. The Bank at the same time publishes a variety of educational materials. In 2005 it published four versions (for primary, middle and high school students, and for the general public) of the BOK’s Easy Economic Story, a standard set of economic education materials. It has also put out comic books and handbooks covering basic economic and financial concepts since 2005.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the Bank has since September 2006 provided online economic education at its website (www.bok.or.kr), aimed at diverse audiences of children, youths, and adults.
