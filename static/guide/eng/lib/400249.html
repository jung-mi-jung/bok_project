			<h3 class="mt0">Issuing Banknotes and Coins</h3>
			<p>The Bank of Korea has the exclusive right to issue banknotes and coins within Korea. Their dimensions, designs and denominations are determined by the Monetary Policy Board upon the government’s approval. The banknotes and coins thus issued have the status of legal tender within the country for all transactions, both public and private, without limitation.</p>
			<p>The issuance of banknotes and coins depends ultimately on decisions made by the Bank in line with its monetary policy. There is no maximum limit imposed on the issuance of banknotes and coins.</p>
			<p>There are currently four different denominations of banknotes in circulation: 1,000-won, 5,000-won, 10,000-won and 50,000-won; and six of coins: 1-won, 5-won, 10-won, 50-won, 100-won and 500-won. The Bank has issued redesigned 5,000-won banknotes since January 2006, and redesigned 1,000-won and 10,000- won banknotes since January 2007. These new banknotes incorporate sophisticated anti-counterfeiting features with reduced size.</p>
			<p>In addition, the Bank put 50,000-won banknotes, as a new highest denomination, into circulation on June 23, 2009, so as to reduce the inconvenience arising from the previous denomination structure.</p>

			<h3>Formulating and implementing Monetary and Credit Policy</h3>
			<p>The most important mission of the Bank of Korea is its formulation and implementation of monetary policy. This involves controlling the supply and value of money so that the economy can grow in a sound manner on the basis of price stability. To this end, the Bank conducts its monetary policy with an emphasis on price stability, while also taking into account such matters as economic growth and financial system stability.</p>
			<p>The Bank introduced an inflation targeting regime in 1998, changing the operational framework for its monetary policy from monetary aggregate-oriented to interest rate-oriented, with the call rate (the uncollateralized overnight rate) constituting its policy rate and operating target. The Bank then reformed and realigned its monetary policy framework again in March 2008, through measures including a change in the policy rate from the call rate target to the Bank of Korea Base Rate, improvement of the reserve requirement system, the regularization of open market operations, and the introduction of standing facilities.</p>
			<p>Inflation targeting is the monetary policy regime adopted by the Bank of Korea. This monetary policy framework focuses on inflation itself as the ultimate goal, which it aims to achieve over a mid-term horizon, instead of setting intermediate targets such as money supply aggregates.</p>
			<p>Based on Article 6, Clause 1 of the Bank of Korea Act, the Bank sets the mid-term inflation target in consultation with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The inflation target for 2016 onwards has been set at 2 percent, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bank conducts monetary policy to maintain the annual rate of CPI inflation near the target over a mid-term horizon.</p>
			<p>The Bank of Korea publishes its Monetary Policy Report, a statutory report submitted to the National Assembly, four times a year to explain how it is implementing the inflation target policy. If inflation deviates from the target by more than 0.5 percentage point in either direction for six consecutive months, the Bank explains the reasons for the deviation, the future prospects for inflation, and the monetary policy strategy for returning inflation to the target; such explanation may be provided through various means, such as a Governor’s press conference. If inflation subsequently remains more than 0.5 percentage point above or below the target, the Bank of Korea provides further explanations every three months.</p>
			<p>The current inflation target has been set for the period from 2016 to 2018. The next target will be set before this target expires at the end of 2018. If adjustment of the inflation target becomes necessary, due for instance to unexpected economic shocks at home or abroad or to changes in economic conditions, the Monetary Policy Board will adjust the target in consultation with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.</p>
			<p>To achieve its ultimate goal of maintaining price stability, the Monetary Policy Board sets the Base Rate eight times a year, in overall consideration of price movements, economic activity and financial market conditions. The Bank then attempts to steer the call rate so that it converges with the newly-set Base Rate level, using its policy instruments. Any change in the call rate affects market interest rates such as CD and Treasury bond yields and bank deposit and lending rates. These changes in interest rates tend to influence consumption and investment and, as a result, inflation.</p>
			<p>The Bank conducts its monetary policy mainly through open market operations; lending and deposit facilities and reserve requirements are additional monetary policy instruments available to the Bank.</p>

			<h4>Open Market Operations</h4>
			<p>The Bank of Korea carries out open market operations as and when necessary to affect the level of reserves in the banking system and to steer the overnight call rate toward the Base Rate. Open market operations are conducted in three ways: through the issuance and repurchase of Monetary Stabilization Bonds (MSBs), through securities transactions, and through commercial banks’ deposits with the Monetary Stabilization Account (MSA).</p>
			<p>MSBs, which are issued by the Bank, originated as a major tool of monetary policy during the period when the volume of government and government-guaranteed bonds remained insufficient. As MSBs have relatively long maturities, they are now used for the structural adjustment of market liquidity. By maturity, there are 13 types of MSBs varying from 14-day MSBs to 2-year MSBs. Currently, however, only 91-day, 182-day, 1-year, and 2-year MSBs are issued regularly through competitive bidding.</p>

			<p>이미지============</p>

			<p>Securities transactions involve purchases and sales in the secondary market of government bonds, government-guaranteed bonds, and securities as specified by the Monetary Policy Board. Securities transactions take the form of outright transactions or of repurchase agreements (RPs). Transactions in RPs have since March 2008 been offered regularly on a weekly basis—mostly with seven-day maturities.</p>
			<p>The MSA, a market-friendly term-deposit facility with competitive bidding, was introduced in October 2010. The longest maturity of deposits with the account is 91 days, but the Bank mainly accepts MSA deposits of less than 1-month maturity.</p>
			<p>In 2017, the average balance of MSBs outstanding was 170.2 trillion won. During the same period, the average balances of outstanding RP (net) sales and the MSA stood at 14.4 trillion won and 16.4 trillion won, respectively.</p>
