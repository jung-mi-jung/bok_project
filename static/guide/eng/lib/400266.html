<!--<h2>Greeting</h2>-->
<p class="subject">Thank you for visiting the Bank of Korea Money Museum website.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea Money Museum opened on June 12, 2001, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bank’s establishment. Ever since its founding, the museum has been well-loved as the nation’s central bank museum, becoming a fixture in the heart of downtown Seoul.</p>
<p>In more recent times, the museum has begun to expand its popularity, becoming a destination for visitors both domestic and international. With its modernized exhibition space, the museum now offers a wide range of cultural experiences covering everything from currency to the arts.</p>
<p>We strive to ensure that the Bank of Korea Money Museum will preserve the characteristics of its building as an important national cultural heritage item, while at the same time serve as a living museum where the past and the present can blend together. We are also devoting efforts to make the museum a representative multiplex cultural space by continuingly introducing programs and exhibitions through which exhibits and visitors can interact with each other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will pool our wisdom to ensure that the museum will serve as a venue for vivid educational experiences concerning money and economics, including for children and students, by collecting, preserving, researching and displaying materials related to money, finance and to the Korean economy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy the Bank of Korea Money Museum.</p>
