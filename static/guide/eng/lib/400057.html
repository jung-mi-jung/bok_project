	<li>The reckless reproduction of currency may encourage counterfeiting and forgery, and undermine the integrity of the national currency. In this light, the Bank of Korea, like all other central banks around the world, has been striving to set desirable practices for currency reproduction by establishing currency reproduction guidelines. </li>
	<li>After 1999, the Bank of Korea established the 「Guidelines for the Reproduction of Bank of Korea Notes and Coins」in order to set desirable practices for currency reproduction. According to the Guidelines, if certain conditions are met, persons are permitted to reproduce currency without obtaining approval from the Bank of Korea.</li>
	<li>However, the use of imitations outside the scope of the Guidelines requires prior permission from the Bank of Korea. Imitations should be manufactured as approved and can be used after confirmation by the Bank of Korea staff in charge. If imitations are no longer used or the period of reproduction expires, the imitations should be destroyed at the Bank of Korea or at a venue designated by the Bank of Korea, in the presence of the Bank of Korea staff.</li>
	<li>The Bank of Korea owns the copyright to the Bank of Korea currency, and unauthorized currency reproduction is prohibited under the Copyright Act. The making, importing, exporting or selling of things similar to Korean currency for the purpose of uttering is subject to punishment pursuant to the Criminal Act.</li>
