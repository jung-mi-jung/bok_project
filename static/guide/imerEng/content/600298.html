        <p>Founded on April 7, 1995, Monetary and Finance Research Forum (Monetary& Finance ERF) consists of members of the Bank of Korea and outside experts to discuss monetary and financial issues.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>At Monetary and Finance Research Forum, experts share research information and ideas, conduct in-depth research, and discuss relevant theories and major policy challenges on economic issues. In order to provide a theoretical basis for policy-makers, the forum aims at better understanding and analyzing of economic issues.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Regular meetings are held on a quarterly basis and a pre-meeting is usually arranged prior to a regular session. A 9-member steering committee (two from the BOK and 7 from outside the Bank) selects themes for discussions.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Regular meetings are composed of two sessions, each of which is joined by a presenter, discussants, a moderator and around 50 members in and outside the Bank.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>If you are interested in joining the forum, please contact Financial and Monetary Economics Team ( 82-2-759-5395, hibkkim<a href="mailto:bokfmet@bok.or.kr" class="a-hover colorBk a-always">@bok.or.kr</a> ).</p>
