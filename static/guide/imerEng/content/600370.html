            Digital Money: Navigating a Changing Financial Landscape

    <p class="fc1">The growth of digital money in recent years underlies many purported benefits that could boost
        productivity and improve economies. Prospects of greater efficiency, lower costs, and higher inclusion have the
        potential to improve people's access to financial services. National authorities in many countries have
        considered and experimented with CBDCs, global bodies such as the BIS are exploring applications for
        cross-border payments, and private entities increasingly utilize stablecoins and other applications. Asian
        economies are at the forefront of innovation with significant crypto adoption and CBDC development.</p>
    <p>With this growing interest, concerns about financial stability risks have also surfaced, while the ongoing
        “crypto winter” and the failure of important entities have underscored the case for consumer and investor
        protection along with better governance and regulation. While the growth of this industry has generated
        innovation, such as decentralized finance and tokenization, the market and use cases remain niche at this point.
        As the debate between the benefits and risks of digital money crystalizes, policymakers are being called upon to
        decide on strategic approaches and regulatory paths.</p>
        <br>
    <p>The objective of this conference is to discuss the opportunities and challenges of digital money, including
        prospects for use cases, the future of money and the role of central banks, the prospective cross-border use of
        CBDCs, the symbiosis of stablecoins and CBDCs, emerging approaches to crypto regulation, and the high-level
        perspective from regional central banks. The conference will be informed by current research by the IMF and
        relevant stakeholders, along with private sector input, and will seek to promote the global policy agenda with a
        regional dialog among Asia-Pacific countries.</p>
