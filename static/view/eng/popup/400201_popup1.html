		<p>Korea joined the IMF on August 26, 1955, as the 58th country to enter the Fund, with the aim of procuring funds necessary for its economic development. Upon its accession, Korea's quota in the IMF was SDR 12.5 million, only 0.14% of the total. As Korea's importance in the global community has increased through its economic development, however, by end-September 2021, its quota had increased to SDR 8,582.7 million (1.80% of the total, 16th among all members).</p>
		<p>Due to its weak economic condition, for a considerable period of time since its IMF accession in 1955, Korea had been able to avail itself of the Transitional Agreements (Article XIV of the Articles of Agreement), which allow restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. In the mid-1980s, however, when Korea's balance of payments position improved, it eased some foreign exchange regulations related to external transactions. From November 1, 1988, Korea became subject to Article VIII, which prohibits discriminatory or multilateral currency agreements and also prohibits foreign exchange regulation on current international transactions.</p>
		<p>In the late-1980s, Korea was then acknowledged for the soundness of its balance of payments and external reserve conditions, as its balance of payments had recorded continual surpluses. In March 1987, Korea was included on the IMF's financial transaction counterparty list. Since then it has been delisted a few times, but has now remained solidly on the list since March 2002.</p>
		<p>Korea and the IMF concluded their first stand-by agreement (an agreement through which a country can receive a loan from the IMF on the condition that it comply with policy requirements and implement related programs) in 1965, under which Korea could receive SDR 9.3 million to maintain FX rate stability and make-up for its balance of payments deficits. After that, Korea obtained loans on sixteen occasions, with a total value of U$1.68 billion, until 1987. As its balance of payments improved from 1987, this whole amount had been repaid by 1988. However, when Korea faced financial crisis in late-1997, it signed another stand-by agreement with the IMF, this time worth SDR 15.5 billion. Korea subsequently withdrew SDR 14.41 billion in all, and had repaid the entire amount by August 2001.</p>
		<p>Since joining the IMF, Korea has received technical assistance several times in various areas. The technical assistance it has received most recently has addressed the following issues: harmonious operation of monetary and FX policy (1999), methods of statistical measurement and accounting of derivatives (2000), implications of the adoption of financial futures on the FX market and methods of response (2000), foreign reserve risk management (2003), measurement of the appropriate FX rate level (2003), and money market development (2007).</p>
		<p>Korea also provides various kinds of resources to IMF. As of February 2024, the Bank of Korea is one of 40 members that have signed New Arrangements to Borrow with the IMF, by which Korea has promised to provide a credit line worth SDR 6,700 million(1.9% of the aggregate commitments from the 40 participating countries) should the international financial system be threatened by a financial crisis of an IMF member. Korea has also committed SDR 4.6 billion (USD 6.5 billion) as of February 2024 to the IMF as part of a bilateral borrowing agreement, which was adopted at the G20 Summit held in Los Cabos, Mexico, in June 2012. The Bank of Korea has also provided SDR 1,000 million for the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), created to facilitate economic growth and to reduce poverty in developing economies, and SDR 1,450 million for the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) established to deal with long-term structural changes, such as climate change.</p>
		<p>In accordance with Article IV of the Articles of Agreement, IMF conducts Article IV Consultations with Korea regularly. The Bank of Korea participates in this consultation, and discusses with the IMF mission team Korea' macroeconomic and financial market developments and prospects, and the BOK's implementation of monetary policy.</p>
		<p>Along with the World Bank, the IMF has been operating its Financial Sector Assessment Program, in order to strengthen members' resilience against financial crises through determining the soundness, vulnerabilities and risks of their financial institutions and financial markets and helping them build sound financial systems. Korea participates in this program in 2003, 2013, and 2019, consulting with the IMF on its monetary policy, macroeconomic policy, foreign exchange policy, and financial market infrastructure. The IMF has acknowledged Korea's high level of transparency and stability in these areas.</p>
		<p>In collaboration with the government, the Bank of Korea represents Korea in various meetings held by the International Monetary Fund and presents Korea's position there. These meetings include the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings, IMFC meetings held in the spring and autumn. In addition to participating in these official meetings, the Bank of Korea delegations also meet with international financial experts during the periods of these meetings. Through such activities, the Bank of Korea promotes economic diplomacy by making known the current status of the Korean economy and its monetary policies.</p>
		<p>The Bank of Korea handles money transactions with the IMF on behalf of the country. After Korea became a member of the IMF in 1955, the Korean government began directly investing (including contributions) in international financial organizations including the IMF. Since revision of the "Act on Joining International Financial Organizations" on November 16, 1971, however, the responsibility for carrying out capital transactions with such organizations has belonged to the Bank of Korea.</p>
